      <h1>What You Mean to Me</h1>

      <div class="letter">
        <p>
          This page is for the things I don’t always say out loud, but feel all the time.
          Being with you has brought a sense of comfort and happiness into my life. You make things feel
          lighter just by being there, and I’m grateful for that more than you know.

          I find myself thinking about all the little adventures that we will go on together. I’m excited to
          watch every movie series ever together (first by finishing off Star Wars), finding new favorites,
          rewatching the ones we already love, and turning our nights into something special just
          by spending them side by side. I can’t wait to travel with you, to see new places together, and
          to make memories that feel uniquely ours.

          I want to learn to grow together, not just in our relationship, but as individuals too. I’m excited
          to support you in everything you want to do, and to keep working toward my own goals alongside
          you, learning, improving, and figuring things out together. It means a lot to me that we can be
          ourselves while still choosing each other.

          You’ve probably realized now that I notice the little things about you,the way you laugh, the shy
          giggles you try to hide when I shower you with love, and how cute you are when you don’t quite know
          how to react to it. I love how you tease me for the way I talk, for how I mess around with my friends,
          and how you see all sides of me and choose to stay anyway. Those small moments are the ones that stick
          with me the most.


          I want you to know that I don’t forget the details. I notice what makes you smile, what makes you
          comfortable, and what makes you feel safe. And when you need me, truly need me, I want to
          be there for you. I want to take care of you, support you, and show up in the ways that matter —
          not because I feel like I have to, but because I want to.

          I choose you. I’m grateful for you. And I’m excited for everything we still have ahead of us.
