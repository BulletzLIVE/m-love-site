            <p>
            I hope this doesn’t come off as too much, but I’ve found such genuine joy and comfort in our relationship.
This gift is just a small token of my appreciation for you and for 
everything you do to make our time together feel so special, 
even if it doesn’t seem like a lot right now.
It’s really just a memory of us, one that I find myself replaying 
over and over.

I remember planning for that day so vividly. 
I wanted everything to feel right, 
from the little details to the way the night unfolded.

            <p>
            Before we even left, when you stepped out of the bathroom in my dorm 
            and I handed you those flowers, I remember feeling completely stunned. 
            You looked so beautiful that for a moment I forgot what I was even 
            supposed to say. I wanted to ask you right then and there to be my girlfriend, but I wasn’t brave enough yet. I just stood there, taking 
            you in.
            We went out to an Italian restaurant that night, one with warmth, character, 
            and a story behind it. 
            Somehow, Italian places have become something we always seem to lean toward, 
            and I think it started right there. Walking through the Italian district in San Francisco with you, talking as we went, felt different from any walk I’d taken before. We talked about little things and meaningful ones, and with every step I felt closer to you. Being next to you felt easy, familiar, and comforting.

            Dinner felt like it passed both slowly and too quickly at the same time. 
            I remember how natural our conversation felt, how comfortable I was 
            just being myself around you. It was a feeling I hadn’t felt in a long 
            time, and I didn’t want it to end.

            When we finally made it back to my dorm and into my room, everything 
            felt calm in the best way. That’s when I realized I didn’t want to 
            keep waiting. I took a breath, found the courage I’d been missing 
            earlier, and asked you to be my girlfriend. It felt simple, honest, 
            and right.

            That night means a lot to me, not because it was perfect, but because 
            it was us. And every day since has just made that feeling stronger.
